	<h5> Analysis: </h5>
	<p>From the USD Monthly Sales of Hamburgers in 2018, USD Monthly Sales of Chicken Fillet in 2018 and USD Monthly Sales of Fish Fillet in 2018 line graphs, we can see that Sep-18 to Nov-18 had the largest drop in sales throughout the 2018 year. This means that even though there were other drops in sales, the Impossible Burger did have an impact in the sales during the month of October. But as we continue to look at the following months, we can see an increase in sales meaning that the effect of the Impossible Burger did not stick around for long and only the month it was released in. We can also see drops in the months of March, June and December which are largely months with vacation breaks for students and teachers at large. This means that during those peak vacationing times, McDonalds also has drops in sales so they should try to advertise and sell more burgers during the non-peak vacation months.</p>

		<h5> Analysis: </h5>
		<p>According to these line graphs, we can see that although there was a decrease in sales in October 2018, this is not the worst sales that McDonalds has done for the month of October. In 2016, McDonalds did much worse in October than in 2018 which means that overall, McDonalds has improved their sales. The best October was by far 2017 as it had the most sales. From this line graph, we can see that for Hamburgers and Fish Fillet Burgers that the South East region has by far the worst sales at the end of October 2018 and that for Chicken Fillets, it has the second worse sales. This means that marketing needs to revamp all of its materials for the South East region to improve their sales. The bar chart is reflective of all the five regions and the different burgers sold in the Octobers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. We can see clearly that although there was a decrease in sales in October 2018, McDonalds has still improved their sales since October 2016. Overall, the Impossible Burger did not affect McDonalds sales but when you look closely, it did affect the sales for the month of October 2018.</p>

		<h4>Here are the graphs per burger for all five areas for the months of September-November 2018:</h4>

			<h5> Analysis: </h5>
			<p>From these line charts we can see the decrease in USD Sales between the months of September and November 2018. This can lead us to interpret that the Impossible Burger did have an
effect on McDonalds sales for the hamburger, fish fillet burger and chicken fillet burgers. Looking at the November 2018 however, we can see that the effect of the Impossible Burger did not last for long as sales picked up. This means that for the release month of a new item, sales were affected but afterwards, the Impossible Burger did not have an impact overall. What McDonalds can do to counteract that one month decrease in sales because of a new item is to release a new item of their own.

<h2>Daily Sales:</h2>

<h5> Analysis: </h5>
<p>
From the daily sales of the Hamburgers for all five regions line chart, we can tell that daily sales are not steady. Instead, we can see a pattern of sales going up for a day or two and then dropping for many before rising again. From this we can interpret that during the weekday, sales are lower than during the weekend. What McDonalds can do is improve their marketing and specifically market post-workday/school day advertisements to increase their sales during the week.
